# Docker Compose config file
##

# Compose project name, to follow Docker tag for deployment environment (production, staging, feature, testing, local)
# By default, if this is not specified, the directory name is used. The Compose project name is
# prefixed to all resources such as networks/volumes/services, e.g. my-network/my-volume/my-service
# will be created as production_my-network/production_my-volume/production-my-service-1 (note
# underscores, hyphens & numeric suffix), but can be still referenced without the prefix/suffix in
# this Docker Compose file and within the same Docker network.
# This can be overridden in docker-compose.override.yml and is useful when deploying multiple
# instances of the same application on the same machine, e.g. staging & feature, without having to
# make a copy with new unique resource names such as "my-network-feature". See
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/04-version-and-name/ for more info.

# Networks - do not use default network or set name else Compose project name will not be prefixed

# Docker volumes - do not set name else Compose project name will not be prefixed
# Volumes can be accessed on host machine via `Mountpoint` shown in `docker volume inspect <volume>` on Linux
# or `\\wsl$\docker-desktop-data\version-pack-data\community\docker\volumes\` in File Explorer on Windows (if using WSL)

# Services - do not set container_name else Compose project name will not be prefixed.
# All services should be prefixed with "demo-" to prevent conflict with Docker Compose files from other repos
